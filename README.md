# Agentic Supply Chain War Room

A unified detection layer and autonomous command center for global supply chain operations. This platform leverages Agentic AI to monitor, triage, and resolve high-priority logistics disruptions in real-time.

## 🚀 Overview

The **Agentic Supply Chain War Room** is designed to transform traditional supply chain management from reactive reporting to autonomous execution. By ingesting billions of global events, the platform provides a "single pane of glass" for logistics, trade compliance, and threat intelligence.

### Key Pillars
- **Autonomous Execution:** AI agents move beyond insights to execute actions across ERP, WMS, and TMS systems.
- **Global Visibility:** Real-time tracking across 190+ countries and major maritime routes.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Collaborative environment where humans govern autonomous agents.
- **Continuous Learning:** Systems that adapt strategies based on historical disruption outcomes.
